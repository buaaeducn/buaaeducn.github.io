excerpt: "<strong>Advisor:</strong> Prof. Jianshan Zhou <br/><br/><strong>Project Details:</strong> We propose a perception navigation framework based on micro drones for complex enclosed spaces without GPS and with extremely limited computing resources, which solves the problems of large environmental spatial cognitive delay and low trajectory generation efficiency caused by limited computing power of traditional drones in extremely narrow environments. Finally, the safe autonomous flight of micro unmanned aerial vehicles in unknown and complex environments was achieved."
