excerpt: "<strong>Advisor:</strong> Prof. Jianshan Zhou <br/><br/>Project Details:</strong> In this project, We developed a bio-inspired autonomous navigation framework for small UAVs in GPS-denied enclosed spaces. The core innovation lies in integrating the RatSLAM algorithm with spatial memory matrices to achieve robust spatial cognition. Additionally, we constructed a custom flight dataset through autonomous exploration to train an end-to-end navigation model, significantly improving the UAV's adaptability in complex environments."
