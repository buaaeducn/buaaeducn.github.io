excerpt: "<strong>Advisor:</strong> Prof. Huafei Du <br/><br/> <strong>Project Details:</strong> We propose a novel stratospheric bipartite floating system scheme based on stratospheric airships, high-altitude balloons, and a series scheme. Solved the problems of insufficient air holding capacity of a single high-altitude balloon, high energy consumption and weight cost of stratospheric airships, as well as insensitivity, long adjustment time, and heavy structural weight of existing series or traction designs. Ultimately, active wind resistant flight was achieved by fully utilizing the characteristics of the nearby space wind field under low energy consumption conditions, thereby achieving efficient regional residency and controllable flight."
