excerpt: "<strong>Advisor:</strong> Prof. Huafei Du <br/><br/> <strong>Project Details:</strong> In this project, I designed a novel stratospheric twin-hull aerostat system to enhance regional station-keeping and controllable flight capabilities. The core innovation lies in a hybrid configuration that integrates high-altitude balloons and stratospheric airships. This design significantly reduces energy consumption and structural weight while ensuring highly responsive aerodynamic stability."
