excerpt: "<strong>Advisor:</strong> Prof. Zhiyong Cui <br/><br/> <strong>Project Details:</strong> We proposed UAVFormer, an extrinsic-robust multi-UAV 3D detection framework designed to address severe extrinsic noise and multi-view camera occlusion.The core innovation, a Camera-Aware Sampling (CAS) scheme, utilizes an EUGS module to counteract extrinsic projection deviations via Mahalanobis distance, and an LSA mechanism to reweight cross-camera points, effectively mitigating multi-view occlusion and achieving robust BEV perception.<br/><a href='https://github.com/your-username/your-repo' target='_blank'><strong>[Code]</strong></a>"
