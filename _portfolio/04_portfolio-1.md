excerpt: "<strong>Advisor:</strong> Prof. Zhiyong Cui <br/><br/> <strong>Project Details:</strong> In this project, I proposed UAVFormer, an extrinsic-robust multi-UAV 3D detection framework designed to address severe extrinsic noise and multi-view camera occlusion. The core innovation is a novel Camera-Aware Sampling (CAS) scheme. Specifically, I developed an Extrinsic-Uncertainty-Guided Sampling (EUGS) module that leverages Mahalanobis distance to counteract projection deviations caused by extrinsic perturbations. Additionally, I introduced a lightweight Location-Selective Attention (LSA) mechanism to dynamically assess and reweight cross-camera sampling points, effectively mitigating multi-view occlusion issues and achieving state-of-the-art robust BEV perception.<br/><br/> <a href='https://github.com/your-username/your-repo' target='_blank'><strong>[Code]</strong></a>"
