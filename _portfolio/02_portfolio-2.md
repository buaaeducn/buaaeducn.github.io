excerpt: "<strong>Advisor:</strong> Prof. Haiyang Yu <br/><br/> <strong>Project Details:</strong> In this project, I primarily researched and debugged end-to-end models such as BEVFormer and SparseBEV. I successfully addressed complex data loading and model configuration challenges for both the nuScenes dataset and a custom UAV dataset, achieving high-precision Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) perception and control.<br/><br/> <a href='https://github.com/your-username/your-repo' target='_blank'><strong>[Code]</strong></a>"
