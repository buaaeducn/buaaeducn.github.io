excerpt: "<strong>Advisor:</strong> Prof. Haiyang Yu <br/><br/> <strong>Project Details:</strong> We propose a laser radar perception positioning mapping scheme based on A-LOAM, which solves the problem of large accumulated errors and easy map construction failures caused by traditional algorithms running for a long time. Finally, by introducing loop detection for pose correction, the effect of improving real-time positioning accuracy and 3D map consistency of real vehicles in complex environments while maintaining low computational complexity was achieved."
