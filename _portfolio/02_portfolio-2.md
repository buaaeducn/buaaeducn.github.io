excerpt: "<strong>Advisor:</strong> Prof. Haiyang Yu <br/><br/> <strong>Project Details:</strong> In this project, I implemented the A-LOAM framework for high-precision 3D map construction and real-time localization. Using ROS and Velodyne LiDAR, I successfully conducted multi-scenario mapping experiments based on edge and planar feature extraction, achieving robust spatial awareness for autonomous systems."
